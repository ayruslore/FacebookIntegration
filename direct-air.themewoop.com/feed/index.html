				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again.</p>
<p>Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The UK offers its residents an appetising array of food and drink choices. </strong>Students from all over the world are attracted to the country because of its cosmopolitan landscape – a landscape that delivers a variety of culinary tastes, flavours, aromas, and ingredients.</p>
<p>In amongst all this variety, you can still find <strong>traditional British cuisine</strong> – from baked beans on toast to the famous British fry-up. This page will give you a little taster (no pun intended) of the edible delights that the UK offers.</p>
<p>In Scotland the national dish is <i> haggis </i> . Haggis is comprised of sheep innards boiled in a sheep stomach. In Wales leeks, a relative of the onion, are used in many dishes. Welsh <i> rarebit, </i> comprised of a cheesy sauce over</p>
<p><b> <i> Basic Economy. </i> </b> The United Kingdom has one of the largest economies in the world, with a Gross National Product estimate in 1999 at $1.29 trillion (U.S.). Finance, manufacturing, and trade form the base of the economy. The pound sterling is the currency, and it is still being debated whether the nation will join with the its European Union partners and adopt the Euro.</p>
<p><b> <i> Commercial Activities. </i> </b> Banking and finance, including insurance, are mainstays of the economy.</p>
<p><b> <i> Major Industries. </i> </b> The United Kingdom is one of the most industrialized nations on earth and has a strong manufacturing base. Major products include machine tools, aircraft and ships, motor vehicles, electronics, chemicals, coal, petroleum, textiles, and food processing.</p>
<p><b> <i> Trade. </i> </b> One of the leading trading powers in the world, the United Kingdom exported $271 billion (U.S.) and imported $306 billion (U.S.) worth of goods in 1998. Chief exports include manufactured goods, food, chemicals, and fuels. Manufactured goods, machinery, fuel, and food products are imported. Primary trading partners are the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p><b> <i> Division of Labor. </i> </b> Although the nation produces almost two-thirds of its food needs, in 1998, agriculture accounted for less than 2 percent of the workforce sector. Services account for 73 percent, and industry another 25.3 percent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The name London originally referred only to the once-walled &#8220;Square Mile&#8221; of the original Roman city. Today, London has taken on a much larger meaning to include all of the vast central parts of the modern metropolis, with the city having absorbed numerous surrounding towns and villages over the centuries, including large portions of the surrounding &#8220;home counties&#8221;, one of which &#8211; Middlesex &#8211; being completely consumed by the growing metropolis. The term &#8220;Central London&#8221; is widely used on both signs and by the media to decribe the downtown area of the city, which encompasses The City, most of the City of Westminster, and some of the surrounding boroughs. The term &#8220;Greater London&#8221; embraces Central London together with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one continuous urban sprawl within the lower Thames valley. Though densely populated by New World standards, London retains large swathes of green parkland and open space, even within the city centre.</p>
<p><b>Greater London</b> consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London that, together with the office of the Mayor of London, form the basis for London&#8217;s local government. The Mayor of London is elected by London residents and should not be confused with the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The names of several boroughs, such as Westminster or Camden, are well-known, others less so, such as Wandsworth or Lewisham. This traveller&#8217;s guide to London recognises cultural, functional and social districts of varying type and size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ask a Londoner where the centre of London is, you are likely to get a wry smile. This is because historically London was two cities: a commercial city and a separate government capital.</p>
<p>However, the point from which distances to &#8220;London&#8221; are measured is in Trafalgar Square, where the original Charing Cross stood.</p>
<p>The commercial capital was the City of London. This had a dense population and all the other pre-requisites of a medieval city: walls, a castle (The Tower of London), a cathedral (Saint Pauls), a semi-independent City government, a port and a bridge across which all trade was routed so Londoners could make money (London Bridge).</p>
<p>About an hour upstream (on foot or by boat) around a bend in the river was the government capital (Westminster). This had a church for crowning the monarch (Westminster Abbey) and palaces. As each palace was replaced by a larger one, the previous one was used for government, first the Palace of Westminster (better known as the Houses of Parliament), then Whitehall, then Buckingham Palace. The two were linked by a road called &#8220;The Strand&#8221;, old English for riverbank.</p>
<p>London grew both west and east. The land to the west of the City (part of the parish of Westminster) was prime farming land (Covent Garden and Soho for example) and made good building land. The land to the east was flat, marshy and cheap, good for cheap housing and industry, and later for docks. Also the wind blows 3 days out of 4 from west to east, and the Thames (into which the sewage went) flows from west to east. So the West End was up-wind and up-market, the East End (as well as further down river and beyond) was where the city&#8217;s heavy industries were based, and thus became the epicentre of the working classes.</p>
<p>Modern-day London in these terms is a two-centre city, with the area in between known confusingly as the West End. However, even this doesn&#8217;t define the actual central area of London, which extends slightly beyond the City and Westminster, as inner portions of the surrounding boroughs (Kensington &amp; Chelsea, Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and Lambeth) also lie within Central London.</p>
